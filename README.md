# Description
 
This project implements a method of unit testing that serves as the base for embedded systems unit testing. The main framework used for testing is criterion due to its light weight and simple nature and functionality. My main goal is to test a piece of code running on an embedded system. For that purpose I use a debugger to access the code running on the test device, by jumping to the code i want to test and then actually run through the code until it finishes, at which point i retrieve the register information to fetch any kind of return values and machine state. This process is automated using a python integration in gdb. In order for my testing framework to use that information for testing, I use a method a interprocess communication to allow the exchange of information between gdb and my testing framework. Finally after the exchange the return values are then compared and tested.
